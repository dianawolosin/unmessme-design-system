# Context Engine

## Purpose
This directory functions as the **immutable source of truth** for product logic, design intent, and business requirements. It contains the 7 Core Blueprints that the AI must ingest to understand the *why* behind every line of code.

AI agents treat this folder as **Read-Only Context**. Code changes are the *output* of processing these requirements.
